# What is an intake

SEKOIA.IO generates events from several sources (transport and formats). It is a data source for the client. This could be a system like Linux or Windows or a firewall like Fortigate or Netfilter.

Each source has a precise format, that is why we distinguish all of them. This lets us know the severity of an alert: suspicious traffic blocked by a Linux machine but not firstly by the firewall so we have to inform the customer of modifying his firewall configuration. To collect the client data, we created parsers.
