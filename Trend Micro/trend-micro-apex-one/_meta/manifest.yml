  Endpoint Agents: Software agents installed on end-user devices that collect and send security-related data back to the EDR solution.
  Network Traffic: Insights from network packets, connection attempts, and patterns can be used to identify threats.
  Log Files: Logs from operating systems, applications, and services. They can provide valuable information about system events, user behaviors, and potential security incidents.
  Threat Intelligence Feeds: External sources of information about current threats and vulnerabilities. This can be data about known malware signatures, IP addresses associated with malicious activities, etc.
  Cloud Services: If the organization uses cloud-based applications or storage, monitoring these sources can be crucial to identify potential security breaches.
  User Behavior Analytics (UBA): Data that helps the system understand normal user behavior so it can detect anomalies that might indicate a compromise.
  File and Process Activities: Monitoring activities related to files (like creation, modification) and processes can help in detecting suspicious behavior.
  Registry Changes: Especially relevant for Windows-based systems where unauthorized or malicious changes can be indicative of malware or other threats.
  External Devices: Monitoring the connection of external devices, like USB drives, to the network can be crucial, as these can be sources of malware.
  Authentication and Authorization Logs: Monitoring who is logging into which system, and what they're authorized to do, can help catch unauthorized access attempts.
