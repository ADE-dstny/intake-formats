  The Cisco ASA is a security device that combines firewall,
  antivirus, intrusion prevention, and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities.

  Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) is a unified software image, which includes the Cisco ASA features and FirePOWER Services. This unified software is capable of offering the function of ASA and FirePOWER in one platform, both in terms of hardware and software features. 

  Sending Cisco logs to SEKOIA.IO will help you discovering 
  potential network security threats, which are contextualized 
  thanks to our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).
